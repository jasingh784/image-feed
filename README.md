# image-feed

This is a instagram style app built with react native. It feature a feed screen where images are loaded from usplash. 
Each image has a comments section. opening the comments section opens a modal. You can leave comments on each image. The comments are 
stored localing using the AsyncStorage library. https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/

This app is basically the same app as found in this react native book - https://www.newline.co/fullstack-react-native/.
The key difference is that in the book the app is written using class components. I wrote this app using function components and 
hooks. 

App tested on android and ios.
