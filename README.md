# image-feed

This is a instagram style app built with react native. It feature a feed screen where images are loaded from usplash. 
Each image has a comments section. opening the comments section opens a modal. You can leave comments on each image. The comments are 
stored locally using the AsyncStorage library. https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/

This app is basically the same app as found in this react native book - https://www.newline.co/fullstack-react-native/.
The key difference is that in the book the app is written using class components. I wrote this app using function components and 
hooks. 

App tested on android and ios. 

published on expo. If you would like to run this app on your phone go to https://expo.io/@jasingh784/projects/image-feed
